Place Google AppEngine jar dependencies here or set the "gae.jars" property in
your build.properties file.  The jars will be copied to the WEB-INF/lib
directory of the GAE webapp.

As of GAE 1.4.0, the default XSLT impl doesn't work so we need to provide
Xalan as the preferred XSLT library.  (May work with Saxon: haven't tried.)
The following two jars are required from xalan-j (tested with 2.7.1):

    xalan.jar
    serializer.jar

Obtained from http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/.

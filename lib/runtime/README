Place run-time jars used by all webapps here or set the "runtime.jars"
property in your build.properties file.  The jars will be copied to the
WEB-INF/lib directory of each webapp.  The requires jars are:

    jstl.jar
    standard.jar

These jars can be obtained from http://tomcat.apache.org/taglibs/standard/.

Note that these JSTL jars aren't required in the GAE war because GAE supplies
them itself.

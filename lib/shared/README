Place compile-time jars used by all webapps here or set the "api.jars"
property in your build.properties file.  The required jars are:

    el-api.jar
    jsp-api.jar
    servlet-api.jar

These can be obtained from:

    1). GAE SDK lib/shared/ directory
    2). Tomcat lib/ directory
    3). Jetty lib/ directory (servlet-api.jar and jsp-2.1/jsp-api-2.1.jar,
        which includes the EL API)

These jars are _not_ packaged in the war.

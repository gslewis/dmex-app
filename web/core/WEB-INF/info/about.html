<h1>About DaisyMaths Exercises</h1>

<p><b>DaisyMaths</b> was a maths learning program for ages 3-12 developed by
Myles Harding.  Around 2003, a web application was introduced that allowed PDF
problem sheets to be created from selected exercises.  That web application
was written in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> using the
<a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a> web framework and
<a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a> to create the
PDFs.  This site is trying to revive and update that original web
application.</p>

<p>The <b>DaisyMaths Exercises</b> web application is written in Java using
basic Servlet and JSP technology.  It is still very much a work in progress
and should be considered to be in <em>alpha</em> state.</p>

<p>The source code is freely available from
<a href="http://github.com/gslewis/dmex-app">GitHub</a>.  The project provides
a number of web applications:</p>

<ul>
    <li>An interactive web-form application where problems are answered
    online.</li>
    <li>A
    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>-ready
    version of the web-form application.</li>
    <li>A PDF problem sheet generator application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pre-built WAR files, that can be run in a web container such as
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Tomcat</a> or
<a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, can be obtained
<a href="http://www.gslsrc.net/dmex">here</a>.</p>

<h1>DaisyMaths Exercises Help</h1>

<p>The steps involved in completing an exercise session are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Choose the exercise.</li>
    <li>Configure the exercise on the <em>Settings</em> page.</li>
    <li>Answer each problem until the session is complete or you have had
    enough.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can click the <em>[info]</em> link next to the exercise name to find
out about the nature of the exercise and what its settings mean.</p>

<h2>Answering problems</h2>

<p>When you have configured the exercise and clicked the
<code>Next;&gt;</code> button, you are taken to the <em>Problem</em> page
which shows one problem at a time in a web-form.  Fill out each blank field
with the answer and click the <code>Submit</code> button (or press
<code>&lt;Return&gt;</code>) to submit your answer.  If correct, you will
proceed to the next problem or the <em>Finish</em> page if you have completed
all problems in the session.  If incorrect, error messages are shown and you
can try again.</p>

<p>If the problem has multiple blank fields to fill out (such as
<strong>Long Multiplication</strong>) then the field focus will follow the
sequence used to complete the problem.  For example, in long multiplication,
you fill out the rows from top-to-bottom but each row is filled out from
right-to-left (least significant digit to most significant digit).  Pressing
<code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code> will advance the focus to the next field; pressing
<code>&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;</code> will back the focus up to the previous
field.</p>

<p>If there are multiple fields then typing a number in the current field will
automatically advance the focus to the next field so you don't need to use
<code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code> to advance manually.</p>

<h3>Number pad</h3>

<p>At the left of the <em>Problem</em> page is a number pad which allows you
to complete problems using the mouse only.  Clicking on a number will enter
that number in the next field to be filled out (the field doesn't need to have
focus).</p>

<p>Clicking the &quot;equals&quot; symbol will submit the problem and clicking
the &quot;back-arrow&quot; will move the focus back to the previous field.</p> 

<h3>Buttons &amp; links</h3>

<p>Clicking the <code>Skip</code> button will skip the current problem and
show the next problem.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code>Show</code> button will show the complete answer to the
current problem: from here you can click the <code>Next&gt;</code> button to
proceed to the next problem.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code>Finish</code> button will end the session and show a
summary of your results.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code>Restart session</code> link will abandon the results of
the current session and start a new session.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code>New session</code> link will take you back to the
exercise configuration page so that you can try a different difficulty,
etc.</p>

<h3>Solution demonstration</h3>

<p>Some exercises may include a demonstration of the solution: a
<code>Solve</code> button is shown beneath the number pad if a demonstration
is available.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code>Solve</code> button will pop up a demonstration panel with <code>Next</code> and <code>X (close)</code> buttons.  The panel displays an explanation of each step in solving the problem.  Clicking the <code>Next</code> button advances to the next step.  When there are no more steps, the <code>Done</code> button is shown.</p>

<p>At any time you can dismiss the demonstration panel by clicking the
<code>X (close)</code> button.  The problem page itself is disabled while the
demonstration panel is open.</p>

<h1>DaisyMaths Problem Sheets Help</h1>

<p>The steps involved in making a problem sheet are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Choose the exercise for which you want to generate problems.</li>
    <li>Configure the exercise on the <em>Settings</em> page.</li>
    <li>Select the number of problems you would like per problem sheet.</li>
    <li>Click one or more of the <em>Download</em> links to receive your
    PDF.</li>
</ol>

<p>At any time you can click the <em>[info]</em> link next to the exercise
name to find out about the nature of the exercise and what its settings
mean.</p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>The <em>Download</em> page will present up to three download links:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Download work sheet</dt>
    <dd>Contains the blank problems for the student to solve.</dd>
    <dt>Download answer sheet</dt>
    <dd>Contains the same problems with the answers filled out.</dd>
    <dt>Download work sheet with answers in margin</dt>
    <dd>Has blank problems on the main part of the page with the answers shown
    in the page margin.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can download all three PDFs if you wish: they will contain the same
problems.  If you refresh the <em>Download</em> page &mdash; by clicking the
<em>Refresh</em> button or using your browser's refresh &mdash; then a new set
of problems will be generated.  This allows you to configure the exercise and
choose the number of problems then generate multiple unique work sheets with
those settings.</p>
